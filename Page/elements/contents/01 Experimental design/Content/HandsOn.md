# Hand on: Experimental design and Analytical planning

## Case study 1: Investigating the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease 
- Design a multi-omics study to understand the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.
- Consider the use of techniques such as next-generation sequencing, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics analysis to integrate data from multiple omics levels.

## Case study 2: Characterizing the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma 
- Develop a study design to analyze the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles of tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal cells within the glioblastoma microenvironment.
- Consider the use of single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to capture the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment.

## Case study 3: Unraveling the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease 
- Design a multi-omics study to identify key genetic, epigenetic, and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
- Consider the integration of data from genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to gain a comprehensive understanding of the disease mechanisms.

## Case study 4: Understanding the impact of environmental factors on brain development
- Develop a study design to investigate the effects of environmental exposures such as toxins, pollutants, and nutritional factors on the omics profiles of developing brain tissues.
- Consider the use of longitudinal omics profiling to capture the dynamic changes in genetic, epigenetic, and molecular pathways over time.

## Case study 5: Personalized medicine approach for brain cancer treatment 
- Design a multi-omics study to identify molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for individual brain cancer patients.
- Consider the integration of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to guide personalized treatment strategies based on the molecular profiles of each patient's tumor.

## Case study 6: Development of a novel drug for enhanced efficacy in non-surgical treatment of inoperable cancer patients requiring constrictive therapeutic intervention 
- Designing a study involves the formulation of a plan to choose participants and establish the criteria for inclusion and exclusion.
- Leveraging a multi-omics approach to pinpoint the molecular target of a novel drug and assess its effectiveness in comparison to the traditional pharmaceutical.

## Case study 7: Investigate the impact of an exercise regimen on individuals with obesity
- **Hypothesis:** Aerobic training may prove to be efficacious in mitigating obesity.
- **Study design:** Estimate sample size, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and general information in human study.
- **Objective:** Identify molecular mechanisms to improve the well-being of obesity using a multi-omics study.

## Case study 8: Agricultural product's impact on plant growth rate
- **Hypothesis:** Notable increase in rooting rate is attributed to the designed agricultural product.
- **Study design:** Evaluate the hypothesis and employ testing methods to investigate and validate.
- **Multi-omics approaches:** Identify molecular mechanisms of the agricultural product compared to conventional products in markets.
