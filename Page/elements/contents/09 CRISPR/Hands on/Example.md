# Hand-on CRISPR

## Research problem

Chemoresistant genes are associated with a poor response to chemotherapy in many types of cancer patients. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques can be employed to knock out several chemoresistant genes in cancer cells, enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drug. In vitro CRISPR-Cas9 applications in cancer cells require a specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) to target our gene of interest, and the delivery methods are crucial for ensuring specificity and effectiveness.
To knock out the target chemoresistant gene in cancer cells, consider the following questions:

1. Which chemoresistant gene will be chosen for knockout through CRISPR-Cas9 techniques?

2. How to design the specific sgRNA for the target gene?

3. Which delivery method should be chosen, and what considerations are there for the study design?

4. What are the outcomes of this study after gene knockout using CRISPR-Cas9 techniques?
